prototypal inheritance:
- nonprimitive types have some properties/methods associated with them. 
array.prototype.push
string.prototype.toUpperCase()
can do array.__proto__.__proto__see what you can do

primitive types have object wrappers- js will automatically "box" values so you can access methods
for example, 42.toString wouldn't work but const num = 42 --> num.toString wouldn

JS engine: before executing the code: engine reads entire file throwing syntax error if one is found
function def's will be saved in memory. Variable initializaions won't be run but lexically scoped variable names will be declared.


Global obj:
all variables/functions are parameters and methods on the global object
browser global object to the "window"
node.js global obj in the "global" object
